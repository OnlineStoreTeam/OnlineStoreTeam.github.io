            <Typography component="h4" variant="p" mb={1.5} fontWeight={700}>Consider Your Dog's Size and Breed</Typography>
            <Typography component="p" variant="h5" lineHeight="150%" mb={6}>One size does not fit all when it comes to dog clothing. Different breeds have varying body shapes and sizes. Measure your dog's neck, chest, and length to ensure a proper fit. Many brands provide sizing charts to help you choose the right size, so be sure to refer to these guides when shopping.</Typography>

            <Typography component="p" variant="h5" lineHeight="150%" mb={6}>Just like humans, dogs have different clothing needs depending on the weather. In colder months, opt for insulating and warm clothes like sweaters, coats, and booties to keep your pup cozy during outdoor adventures. In warmer weather, lightweight and breathable options like T-shirts and cooling vests can help your dog stay comfortable.</Typography>

Look for designs with adjustable closures and elastic bands that provide flexibility without compromising fit. For less active dogs or those recovering from surgery, consider garments that are easy to put on and take off.</Typography>
            <Typography component="h4" variant="p" mb={1.5} fontWeight={700}>Prioritize Safety and Comfort</Typography>
            <Typography component="p" variant="h5" lineHeight="150%" mb={6}>Ensure that the clothes you choose don't have any small parts that your dog could chew on or swallow. Opt for materials that are soft, non-restrictive, and hypoallergenic to avoid irritation. Always check for any tags or seams that could cause discomfort.</Typography>
            <Typography component="h4" variant="p" mb={1.5} fontWeight={700}>Style and Aesthetics</Typography>
            <Typography component="p" variant="h5" lineHeight="150%" mb={6}>While functionality is crucial, style can also be a factor.
